// Core algorithm for the handmade BIP-39 generator.
// Pure logic, no DOM — testable under Node and reusable verbatim inside the SPA.
//
// Design recap (per spec worked out with the user):
//  - A phrase is T = 12, 15, 18 or 24 words (PHRASE_SIZES below).
//  - User supplies N words (12<=N<=22 at T=24), sourced from physical dice +
//    printed tables.
//  - Words are used VERBATIM for positions 1..N.
//  - Words T-1 and T are ALWAYS device-sourced (CSPRNG mixed with user screen
//    interaction) — capping user input at T-2 avoids ever needing a user-guessed
//    word T that gets silently checksum-corrected, so there's nothing to explain
//    about a "wrong" final word.
//
// importMnemonic is the other door, and deliberately not the same one: it takes
// a complete phrase the user already holds, generates nothing, and
// REFUSES a bad checksum instead of correcting it. It exists so an existing
// phrase can be split with codex32 by this page. See its own comment.
//
// Color tags: 'user' (green, verbatim), 'device' (yellow, generator-sourced).

/* BIP-39 sizes. A phrase of T words carries T*32/3 bits of entropy followed by
   a checksum of entropy/32 bits, and the two always add up to 11*T:

     T=24  ->  256 entropy + 8 checksum = 264 = 11*24   last word: 3 + 8
     T=18  ->  192 entropy + 6 checksum = 198 = 11*18   last word: 5 + 6
     T=15  ->  160 entropy + 5 checksum = 165 = 11*15   last word: 6 + 5
     T=12  ->  128 entropy + 4 checksum = 132 = 11*12   last word: 7 + 4

   The last word is the only one that straddles the boundary, and how it
   straddles differs at every length: at 24 words it is 3 entropy bits then 8
   of checksum, at 12 it is 7 then 4, and 18 and 15 sit in between. Everything
   below reads those numbers off this table rather than spelling them out,
   because the pair that is easy to transpose is exactly the pair that
   produces a valid-looking wrong phrase.

   The words you may roll follow one rule at every length: at least half the
   phrase, rounded up, and at most all but the last two, which the device
   always writes. That is 6..10 at 12 words, 8..13 at 15, 9..16 at 18 and
   12..22 at 24. */
