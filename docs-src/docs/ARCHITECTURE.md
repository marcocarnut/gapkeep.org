# GapKeep architecture

GapKeep is a single-purpose, bare-metal system for the Raspberry Pi Zero
(BCM2835, one ARM1176 core, 512 MB). It boots straight into a JavaScript app
runtime with a graphical interface. There is no Linux, no network stack and
no radio; the SD card is read once at boot, for the apps and their data, and
never written: once the launcher is up it can be removed.

## Boot

1. The GPU's boot ROM loads `bootcode.bin` from the SD card, which loads
   `start.elf`. Both are Broadcom's closed firmware; every OS on the Pi
   depends on them.
2. `start.elf` sets up HDMI, reads `config.txt`, and loads `kernel.img`
   (GapKeep) to 0x8000 on the ARM core.
3. Circle's startup code sets up the stack (1 MB), MMU and caches, and calls
   `main()` → `CKernel` (`src/kernel.cpp`).
4. The kernel brings up the screen, the serial log, interrupts and the
   timer, reads the apps, `gapkeep.txt` and the data folders the apps list
   from the SD card (`CAppStore`) and unmounts it, brings up USB (keyboard
   and mouse are found by plug-and-play; after the apps, so that devices
   they list are claimed for them from the start), then LVGL, the keyboard
   input device and the app host.
5. The app host starts the launcher.

## Main loop

Everything runs in one loop on one core; there are no threads:

```
loop:
    USB plug-and-play     (new keyboard, mouse, or device claimed for apps?)
    keyboard LEDs
    LVGL                  (read input, run timers, redraw)
      └─ input events and JS timers call into the running app's JS
    app host              (USB devices' events and one control transfer (gk:usb),
                           promise jobs, deferred widget deletion, app switch)
```

USB interrupts only queue key presses (`CKeyboardIndev`) and set the Home
flag; all JavaScript runs from the main loop.

## The app host (`src/runtime/apphost.*`)

Runs one app at a time. Starting an app:

1. A new **QuickJS runtime** with a 96 MB heap limit, a 512 KB stack limit, a
   module loader and an interrupt handler (watchdog, Ctrl+C and Home key).
2. A new **LVGL screen** and **focus group**; the keyboard is pointed at it.
3. The app's entry module is evaluated. It imports `gk:*` modules (created
   on demand, permission-checked) and its own files (from memory).

Stopping an app (exit, Home, or launching another) deletes its screen, which
deletes every widget and releases its JS handlers; then its timers; then its
JS context and runtime. `JS_FreeRuntime` asserts that every object was
freed, so a leak in the runtime shows up as a crash in testing rather than
slow memory loss.

Apps come from two places (`src/runtime/appstore.*`), with the same checks
and the same description (`gk_app_t`):

- **Built in**, at build time (`tools/bundle_apps.py` →
  `src/generated/apps_bundle.c`): the launcher always; every app in sealed
  and test builds.
- **The SD card's `/apps` folder**, read once at boot into memory by
  read-only FatFs (`lib/fatfs`, configured with `FF_FS_READONLY`, so no
  write code is even compiled) over Circle's SD driver. Each app is checked
  (manifest, names, UTF-8, size limits) and hashed; refused apps are listed
  in the launcher with the reason. A card app cannot take a built-in app's
  id. The data folders the apps list (`/data/<name>`) are read at the same
  time, whole, and hashed. Then the card is unmounted: every FatFs call
  goes through `GkCardGuard` (`src/runtime/cardfs.h`), which after boot
  refuses it and logs an error, so nothing can come to depend on the card
  staying in (`tests/card_removal.txt` takes it out).

After boot no code is loaded: apps cannot load code
other than their own modules, which are already in memory, and the only
files they read are the data folders their manifest names (`gk:data`,
read whole and hashed at boot, served from memory).

Apps never share code at run time: an app's hash covers every line of
JavaScript it runs, so one that builds on another's library carries a
byte-for-byte copy (`tools/share_libs.py`). Data, unlike code, is
shared by name: read-only folders on the card (`data/<name>/`, through
`gk:data`), listed in the manifest and outside the app hash. Suites
(`apps/<suite>/suite.json`) only group apps in the launcher. The reasons are in
[DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#apps).

### Widgets (`src/runtime/js_ui.cpp`)

Each widget is a JS object linked to an LVGL object through a `TGkNode`.
While the LVGL object exists, the node keeps the JS object alive, so the same
JS object is returned every time (`label.parent === container`). LVGL's
delete event releases it. JS never deletes LVGL objects directly:
`widget.delete()` hides the widget and queues it, and the host deletes it
after event processing. That keeps "a button deletes itself in its click
handler" safe.

All properties are described by one table; constructors, `set()` and the
per-type property accessors all go through it, with strict validation.

The wall clock (`clock.cpp`, `gk:clock` in `js_clock.cpp`) is kept by the
kernel from the system timer, with a trim and a UTC offset; see
[CLOCK.md](CLOCK.md).

The session store (`session.cpp`, `gk:session` in `js_session.cpp`) keeps
values for each app across its runs, in the kernel's heap, until power-off.
Entries are filed under the app's id and hash; values are serialized by
QuickJS's object writer (plain data only: no bytecode, no references) and
copied in and out. Every byte is overwritten before it is freed.

Languages (`i18n.cpp`, `gk:i18n`): the language and number marks are the
system's (`gapkeep.txt`, or the Settings app until power-off). When an app
starts, its catalog (`lang/<language>.json`, with `lang/pt.json` under
`lang/pt-BR.json`) is parsed with `JSON.parse`, never evaluated, and each
translation checked (the same `{names}` as its key, no control or bidi
characters); what passes is kept in a null-prototype object. The module
itself is JavaScript, `src/runtime/i18n.js`, embedded by
`tools/embed_js.py` and compiled when an app imports it; its native half,
`gk:i18n-native`, can be imported by it alone. The launcher's catalogs are
the system's: they translate the module's own messages.

USB devices claimed for apps (`usb.cpp`, `gk:usb` in `js_usb.cpp`): a
device whose ids an available app's manifest lists is taken whole by
`src/usbclaim.cpp` (on the Pi) when it turns up; `usb.cpp` reads its
descriptors (`usbdesc.c`), keeps the devices plugged in, and does an app's
control transfers, one per pass of the main loop, each waiting for the
device as Circle's control transfers do (they can't be asynchronous on the
Zero's host controller) and settling a promise. See [API.md](API.md#gkusb).

`ui.epaper` (`epaper.cpp`) is a second LVGL display, off screen, the size
of the e-paper panel `gapkeep.txt` configures: the app's widgets go on its
screen, and a refresh renders it, turns it into the panel's planes and
hands them to the driver (`epd.cpp`) as a job (below). The driver uses
Circle's SPI master and GPIO pins; in the simulator they lead to a
simulated panel, so the same code runs in both. See [EPAPER.md](EPAPER.md).

`ui.Scanner` is driven by `scanner.cpp` (camera frames, decoding with
`qrdecode.cpp`, the preview), polled by an LVGL timer; the camera is an
interface (`camera.h`) with a synthetic implementation (`synthcam.cpp`) for
the simulator and test builds, and a driver for the Pi Camera Module v2.1
(`src/camera/`, kernel only: the sensor over I2C, the CSI-2 receiver, grey
frames and automatic exposure). See [CAMERA.md](CAMERA.md).

### Cryptography (`src/crypto/`)

SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 written from FIPS 180-4, and HMAC from RFC 2104
(`hmac.*`, generic over the three through `gk_hash_t`), all plain C that
also builds on the development machine: `tests/native/test_sha256.c`, and
`tools/check_hashes.py`, which runs every self-test and compares thousands
of random inputs with Python's `hashlib`. SHA-256's self-test runs at boot;
HMAC's test vectors (RFC 2202, RFC 4231, which also check SHA-1, SHA-224,
SHA-384 and SHA-512; SHA-224 and SHA-384 are SHA-256 and SHA-512 with
other starting values) run before their first use, and disable them if
they fail. Every
context and buffer that held key material is overwritten after use. The
hardware RNG wrapper (`hwrng.*`) applies NIST SP 800-90B health tests to
every raw byte and conditions output through SHA-256; see `gk:crypto` in
[API.md](API.md).

RIPEMD-160 (`ripemd160.*`, from its authors' paper, with HASH160) and
PBKDF2 (`pbkdf2.*`, RFC 8018, over `gk_hash_t`) are checked the same way
(`tools/check_hashes.py`). secp256k1 is Bitcoin Core's libsecp256k1
(`third_party/secp256k1`, pinned to a release; built by
`lib/secp256k1/secp256k1.mk` with the extrakeys and schnorrsig modules and
a 16 KiB verification table, about 100 KiB of code and tables in all).
`secp.*` turns its opaque structures into bytes for `gk:crypto`: ECDSA
with RFC 6979 nonces, low S and Bitcoin Core's low-R grinding, BIP-340,
and the BIP-32 and Taproot tweaks. Its context lives in a static buffer
(no allocation), is blinded with random bytes, and halts the system on an
illegal-argument or internal-error callback, which only a bug can reach.
`tools/check_secp.py` compares it with an independent pure-Python
implementation (SEC 1, RFC 6979, BIP-340, BIP-341) on random keys and edge
cases, runs BIP-340's test vectors, writes the known answers of the
kernel's self-test (`secp_kat.h`), and runs the library's own test suite
built as for the Zero (32-bit arithmetic); that suite also passes compiled
for ARMv6 under `qemu-arm`. RIPEMD-160, PBKDF2 and secp256k1 run their
self-tests before their first use. BIP-32, addresses and transactions are
left to apps, in JavaScript on these primitives.

OpenPGP's primitives: Ed25519 (`ed25519.*`) is Monocypher's
(`third_party/monocypher`, 4.0.3, its optional RFC 8032 code with
SHA-512), with a stricter point decoding (RFC 8032, 5.1.3, step 4) and each
signature verified before it is returned. RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures
(`rsa.*`) and AES-CFB (`aes.*`) run on a crypto-only subset of Mbed TLS
3.6 LTS (`third_party/mbedtls`: only the files `lib/mbedtls/mbedtls.mk`
builds, configured by `lib/mbedtls/gk_mbedtls_config.h`; its wipes are
`gk_wipe`): its constant-time bignum, and its private operation's steps
(base and exponent blinding, the CRT, its check against glitches),
run one by one by `rsa.c` (`gk_rsa_sign_step`: Mbed TLS's
`mbedtls_rsa_private` does them in one call, too long for the main loop)
on the context's own numbers; then the signature is checked again against
the public key. `rsa.c` also does the PKCS #1 encoding (DigestInfo), and
verifies (1024 to 4096 bits; signing keys from 2048) by encoding and
comparing. Imported keys are checked for consistency (n = pq,
de = 1 mod p-1 and q-1, OpenPGP's u) and their CRT values derived, in
memory from Circle's heap (zeroed when freed), at most 64 at a time.
Decryption: RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 (`gk_rsa_decrypt*`) is the same private
operation, then the padding is checked with implicit rejection
(draft-irtf-cfrg-rsa-guidance-10, 7.2, as written: on bad padding a
message derived from d and the ciphertext, every check made and both
candidates read, so nothing tells them apart; checked against the draft's
vectors). X25519 (`x25519.*`) is Monocypher's, refusing an all-zero
shared secret. AES key wrap (RFC 3394) is written in `aes.c` over Mbed
TLS's AES block. SEIPD v1 (`seipd.*`, RFC 9580, 5.13.1) decrypts a copy
of the message in steps, hashing as it goes, and gives the plaintext only
if the MDC matches, the prefix's quick-check bytes ignored; there is no
code for the old unprotected packet.
OpenPGP's AEAD packets (`aead.*`: RFC 9580's SEIPD v2, and GnuPG 2.4's
own OCB packet, tag 20, from LibrePGP) are decrypted in steps with
HKDF-SHA256 (`hmac.*`) and one of three modes behind one interface (a
table in `aead.c`), each written here over Mbed TLS's AES block and
streaming: OCB (`ocb.*`, RFC 7253), EAX (`eax.*`, the EAX paper: CTR and
CMAC) and GCM (`gcm.*`, SP 800-38D, its GHASH multiplying bit by bit
without tables: constant-time, slower). SEIPD v2 takes all three; tag 20
OCB and EAX, as LibrePGP allows (no GCM). Every chunk's tag and the
final tag (over the total length) are checked before the plaintext,
decrypted in place in a copy of the message, is given. The same modes encrypt and decrypt one small
message at once (`gk_aead_encrypt`, `gk_aead_decrypt`: an AEAD-protected
secret key, RFC 9580, 5.5.3), synchronously, up to 256 KiB. Decompression (`runtime/inflate.*`, gk:zlib) is
zlib's inflate (`third_party/zlib`, decompression only, no gzip, the
caller's allocator, which wipes), in steps, its output limited as it
grows; `tools/fuzz_inflate.sh` fuzzes it with sanitizers.
OpenPGP's S2K (`s2k.*`, RFC 9580) is written here, over `gk_hash_t`, and
hashes the repeated salt and passphrase from a 1 KiB buffer, in steps (a
job, below). Argon2id (`argon2.*`, RFC 9106; S2K type 4) is Monocypher's
`crypto_argon2`, restructured to stop and resume at any block (pass,
slice, lane, block), the lanes done one after the other in the RFC's
order; its work area, up to a quarter of the board's memory (from its
revision, at boot: 128 MiB on a 512 MB Pi Zero), comes from Circle's heap (outside
the JS heap) as a job starts, one step per slice (wiping what a stopped
job left, freeing a smaller area, allocating), is kept for the app's next
call, wiped as each job ends, and wiped and freed when the app stops.
Circle's heap never reused a freed block over 512 KiB and panicked when a
large one could not be had; `patches/circle/0017` reuses them (best fit,
at most twice the size) and has a request of 1 MiB or more that does not
fit return 0, so a second large Argon2 run, or a big inflate after one,
works, and running out is an error, not a halt. Both
libraries are vendored unchanged, pinned to a release (source and SHA-256
in their `.mk`). `tools/check_pgp.py` builds these files for the host and
compares them with Python's cryptography (OpenSSL) on random keys and
inputs, runs Wycheproof's Ed25519, RSA, X25519, key wrap, AES-GCM and
AES-EAX vectors, NIST CAVP's CFB128 files, RFC 9580's S2K examples and
sample AEAD packets (A.9 to A.11), Argon2 against the reference
implementation (`--argon2-ref`, and RFC 9580 A.12.1's 2 GiB with `--a12`)
(`tests/native`), and the negative cases;
`tests/apps/pgpcrypto` runs known answers through the JavaScript API on
every target, and `tests/pgp/run_gpg_interop.sh` has GnuPG verify
signatures the simulator made with keys GnuPG exported. The libraries add
about 150 KB to the kernel (no `--gc-sections`).

### C runtime

QuickJS is a hosted C program. GapKeep provides only what it needs:

- Circle: `malloc`/`free`/`realloc`, `mem*`, `str*` basics.
- newlib (from the toolchain): `libm` math functions and headers.
- `src/runtime/libc_shim.c`: about 15 small functions (`snprintf` via LVGL's
  printf, logging `fprintf`, UTC-only `localtime_r`, clocks). Small enough
  to read in a few minutes.
- `lib/quickjs/compat/`: a no-op `pthread.h` (one core, no threads) and an
  `inttypes.h` fix for Debian's toolchain.

QuickJS's own OS layer (`quickjs-libc.c`: files, processes, sockets) is not
built.

QuickJS is compiled with `-fno-strict-aliasing`. On `arm-none-eabi`,
`uint32_t` is `unsigned long`, and QuickJS passes such variables through
`int *` in places; under strict aliasing GCC miscompiled the string
iterator (`for (const ch of "abc")` never ended). QuickJS's own test suite
(`test_language`, `test_builtin`, `test_bigint`, `test_closure`,
`test_loop`) runs on the target in test builds (`tests/qjstests.txt`) to
catch this class of problem.

## Security model

Goal: a machine on which secrets are created and handled without any channel
for them to leave, other than what a person reads off the screen.

**Attack surface that exists:**

| Surface | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| USB host controller + HID parsing (Circle) | The only input from outside. Only the hub, keyboard (boot protocol; with Circle's variant for the 8BitDo Retro Keyboard, picked by its vendor and product ids) and mouse drivers are in the image; every other class driver is left out at build time (`EXCLUDE_USB_*` in `tools/build.sh`), including the generic-HID path and its report descriptor parser. The mouse driver keeps its own, smaller one: it uses the report protocol (for the wheel), so it parses the report descriptor the mouse sends. That parser is bounded, every length, index and offset checked, and a malformed descriptor gets the mouse refused (`patches/circle/0009`); it is fuzzed under AddressSanitizer and UBSan against random, mutated and crafted descriptors (`tools/fuzz_usbmouse.sh`). IN transfers receive whole packets into a bounce buffer, as Linux does, so that a device sending more than was asked for cannot have the controller write past the buffer (`0008`; on the rig, without it, a keyboard declaring 1024-byte packets had 1016 bytes written past its 8-byte report buffer, on every report); keyboards and mice declaring packets over 64 bytes are refused. Control transfers time out after 3 s (`0003`); a device whose control transfers time out twice gets no more until it is replugged, and long timeouts are budgeted across devices (3, then one a minute; beyond that 250 ms); keyboard LED requests get 100 ms, and none after a failure. So a device that never answers, or keeps reconnecting, cannot hang the system nor freeze it for long (`0010`). |
| USB devices claimed for apps (`gk:usb`) | One more path, for the devices an app lists by vendor and product id in its manifest (`"usb"`), and only while an available app lists them: [APPS.md](APPS.md#usb-devices). Circle's device factory asks GapKeep first about each new device (`patches/circle/0014`); a listed one is **claimed whole** by `src/usbclaim.cpp`, and none of its interfaces gets another driver, so a keyboard or mouse in it is ignored and can't type into the system. What is reached: endpoint 0 only, by control transfers of at most 64 bytes, through Circle's (bounded by `0003`, `0008`, `0010`: what a device sends beyond what was asked for stays in the bounce buffer); no interrupt, bulk or isochronous endpoint is opened. Apps may send class and vendor requests, to the device or one of its interfaces, and standard requests that only read (GET_STATUS, GET_DESCRIPTOR, GET_CONFIGURATION, GET_INTERFACE); never SET_ADDRESS, SET_CONFIGURATION, SET_INTERFACE or SET_FEATURE. Each stage gets 1 s; after two timeouts a device gets no more transfers until replugged; at most 4 devices and 16 waiting transfers an app. What GapKeep parses of what the device sends is its device, configuration and string descriptors (`src/runtime/usbdesc.c`: every length checked, names turned to text that may be shown, without control, bidi or invisible characters), fuzzed under AddressSanitizer and UBSan (`tools/fuzz_usbdesc.sh`); everything else goes to the app as bytes, unparsed. The log has ids, names, lengths and request numbers, never the data. The simulator reaches devices over USB/IP instead (`sim/src/usbip.cpp`), with the same code above the port (`src/runtime/usb.cpp`). |
| Camera ([CAMERA.md](CAMERA.md)) | Input only: pictures of QR codes, from the Pi Camera (IMX219, `src/camera/`) or, in test builds and the simulator, a synthetic camera. Decoded in the kernel by zxing-cpp's QR code reader (C++20, about 195 KiB, `patches/zxing-cpp/`), built without exceptions: malformed codes are not read, and what zxing-cpp would throw on an internal error stops the system (a fatal error, as a failed assertion). Fuzzed under AddressSanitizer and UBSan with damaged and crafted codes that reach the payload decoder ([CAMERA.md](CAMERA.md#the-qr-decoder)). Apps get the decoded bytes, never pixels, and only with the `"camera"` permission. |
| Fonts | Not a surface: fonts are a known attack vector (their parsers and hinting interpreters), so apps cannot supply any. Text is drawn from GapKeep's own fonts only: bitmap fonts compiled into the image, and TrueType outlines also compiled in (`src/runtime/fonts/gk_ttf_*.c`, made by `tools/make_fonts.py` from pinned, hashed font packages) that LVGL's TinyTTF (stb_truetype) rasterizes for other sizes and styles (`src/runtime/fontcache.cpp`). Its file loading is compiled out (`LV_TINY_TTF_FILE_SUPPORT 0`), `gk:ui` takes sizes and styles, never font data, and nothing an app, the card or a device sends reaches the TrueType parser. What rasterized glyphs may hold in memory is capped (4 MB for all fonts, freed when the app exits). |
| HDMI output | Output only. CEC is ignored (`hdmi_ignore_cec` in `config.txt`). |
| E-paper panel (SPI0 and three GPIOs, [EPAPER.md](EPAPER.md)) | Output, to a panel `gapkeep.txt` names, only when an app with the `"epaper"` permission asks for a refresh (`ui.epaper`); boot and opening a panel send nothing, and between refreshes every line is an input. What comes back is one bit, BUSY, read for timing (a missing panel, a refresh done). The driver (`src/runtime/epd.cpp`, from EPDPages) runs in slices of the main loop, as a job; there is no GPIO or SPI access for apps. What a panel shows is never logged; its buffers are wiped. |
| Serial port (GPIO 14/15) | Production builds for the Pi contain no serial driver: the UART is never set up, its pins are made inputs, and the firmware's is off (`enable_uart=0`); the log goes nowhere. Test builds log to it and take test commands from it (`src/testshot.*`). |
| SD card | Read by the firmware at power-on (`kernel.img` comes from it, so it must be in then), then by GapKeep, once, at boot: `/apps`, `gapkeep.txt`, and the data folders (`/data/<name>`) the apps list (FAT, read-only driver). Then unmounted; any later FatFs call is refused and logged as an error. Never written; removable once the launcher is up. Sealed builds don't contain the SD code (their data, if any, is built in). A card can be tampered with while the kernel on it is still the genuine one (checked on another computer), so everything the genuine kernel parses from it must be memory-safe on any input: the FAT file system (FatFs), manifests, `suite.json` and catalogs (QuickJS's JSON parser, then GapKeep's checks), icons, `gapkeep.txt`. What it reads is capped: per file, per app, 64 MB for all the apps on a card and 48 MB for all data folders, refused ones included. Names, versions and descriptions shown by the launcher may not hold line breaks, control, bidi or invisible characters (`src/runtime/textcheck.h`); folder names from the card are shown with such characters as `?`. |
| Boot files: `config.txt`, `cmdline.txt` | Read by the closed firmware, outside any hash GapKeep shows. `config.txt` decides what the firmware loads and how the screen is set up (it could even name another kernel file), so the defence against a changed one is the same as against a changed `kernel.img`: check the card's boot files on a trusted computer, against the `SHA256SUMS` `tools/make_sdcard.sh` printed when the card was made (not the copy on the card, which whoever changed the card could change too). The firmware passes `cmdline.txt` to the kernel as its command line; Circle would honour some of its options (`usbignore` turns a USB device off, `width` and `height` change the screen, `keymap`, `loglevel`, USB timing, CPU temperature limits), so GapKeep ignores it: Circle's options parser never reads it (`patches/circle/0013`), and every setting has its default. GapKeep's own settings are in `gapkeep.txt`. |
| VideoCore firmware | Closed. Shared by every Pi OS; out of our control. Pinned by hash (`tools/firmware.sha256`). |

**Nothing is kept.** GapKeep never writes to the card, and the session
store (`gk:session`) is RAM, gone at power-off. So keys are not stored on
the device: they live elsewhere (on paper, as codex32 shares or seed words),
come in when needed, by keyboard or as QR codes shown to the camera, are
recombined in memory for the task (the Signer signs, then forgets them), and
are wiped when the app is done with them (below). Losing or stealing a
switched-off GapKeep reveals no key.

**What is absent by design:** network stack, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (the
plain Pi Zero has no radio at all), writing to storage, file access for
apps (but reading the data folders their manifest names, below), code
loading after boot, a clock you can trust, and any way for apps
to reach each other (each app's session store is its own).

**Apps on the card** are as trustworthy as the card: whoever can write it
can replace `kernel.img` too, so loading apps from it does not move the
trust boundary. The launcher shows each app's SHA-256, on a line of its
own in the monospaced font that no app-chosen text precedes, to compare
with a published one. A sealed build (`tools/build.sh pi SEALED=1`) removes the SD and FAT code
from the trusted base.

**Data folders and suites**: code is inside the app hash, data
(`data/<name>/`, read with `gk:data`) is outside it, on purpose: the hash
must be the same on every card, the data differs per card
([DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md#data-is-shared-by-name) says why). So whoever can
change the card can change the data, as they can the apps, and the defence
is the same: the launcher shows each data folder's hash beside the app's,
and apps show what matters before using it (a key's fingerprint). Apps read
only the folders their hashed manifest names, never write, and the folders
are read whole, hashed and kept in memory at boot (`appstore.cpp`), so
what an app reads is what was hashed, and swapping or removing the card
afterwards changes nothing. A sealed kernel can carry its data instead
(`SEALED=1 DATA=dir`): then the kernel's hash covers it and is per person,
and the data folder's hash lets the keyring be checked on its own. Its e-paper panel, if it
has one, is built in the same way (`SEALED=1 EPAPER=weact-2.9-bwr`, with
the wiring's keys: [EPAPER.md](EPAPER.md#sealed-kernels)), covered by the
kernel's hash too. Nothing in the data is executed; what parses it is FatFs and the
apps' own JavaScript. Apps in a suite share data this way but never code,
so each app's hash still covers every line it runs.

**Runaway apps:** QuickJS calls the app host's interrupt handler as it
runs JavaScript, which stops a call after 10 seconds (the watchdog), on
Ctrl+C, or when the Windows key is pressed. Ctrl+C is taken from the
keyboard in interrupt context, as the Windows key is (`kbdindev.h`), but
only while a call or a run of promise jobs has been under way for half a
second or more; the app keeps running, as after the watchdog (its jobs are
rejected, a banner says it was stopped). Otherwise Ctrl+C is an ordinary
key, delivered to the app. Native work inside one call is not
interrupted: a built-in like `Array.prototype.sort` on a large array,
`JSON.parse` of a long text or BigInt arithmetic on huge numbers runs to
its end (bounded by the 96 MB heap: seconds on a Pi Zero, not minutes),
then the handler stops the app at its next check. GapKeep's own long
native work asks too: `gk:crypto`'s `pbkdf2` checks every 256 iterations
and the AES-CFB functions every 64 KiB, and throw the same uncatchable
"interrupted" error.

**Long native work** (`runtime/jobs.*`): what can take more than a quarter
of a second on a Pi Zero is a *job*, and its call returns a promise
(S2K, Argon2id, PBKDF2, RSA signatures and decryption, SEIPD v1 and AEAD
decryption, decompression). A job is native
state with a step function: the app host's `Update()` gives the first job
of the running app one slice of about 20 ms per pass of the main loop,
after LVGL has read input and drawn, so the screen and the keyboard stay
alive. Jobs run one at a time, in order (16 may wait per app); the promise
is settled from the main loop, as gk:usb's transfers are, and progress is
reported between slices (`onProgress`). When the app stops, its jobs are
dropped (wiped, never settled); when the watchdog (or Ctrl+C) stops one of its
scripts, they are rejected. An app cancels one with an `AbortSignal` (`{ signal }`;
`AbortController` is a small global written in JavaScript in
`js_sys.cpp`, as QuickJS has none): the job adds an "abort" listener, a
native function, so the abort is noticed when JavaScript calls
`abort()`, between slices, and no JavaScript runs from the main loop to
poll for it; a waiting job is dropped, a running one too unless it has an
Abort op (Argon2id: its next slices wipe its memory), and the promise is
rejected with the signal's reason as a promise job, after the running
script. A slice ends at its deadline, overrunning it by at most
one unit of the job's work: 64 KiB of hashing for S2K (a slice lasts 22 ms
on a Pi Zero), one modular exponentiation of the CRT for RSA (220 ms with
4096 bits: `crypto/rsa.c` runs the steps of Mbed TLS's private operation
one by one, blinding and checks included). The same code runs in the
simulator, natively and in WebAssembly.

**Isolation between apps:** each app has its own JS runtime, so apps cannot
reach each other's objects. They share an address space (everything runs
privileged, on one core), so this guards against mistakes and keeps app
code honest, not against native-code exploits. All native code is part of
the image and auditable.

**Memory protection** (`patches/circle/0004`, for the Pi Zero only): the
kernel is mapped with 4 KB pages, so that

- code is read-only (and the only executable memory),
- constants are read-only,
- data, heap and stacks are not executable,
- the exception vectors become read-only once they are set up,
- the unused memory below the kernel stack is unmapped, so a stack
  overflow faults instead of running into the data below it.

Every C and C++ file (Circle, LVGL, QuickJS, GapKeep) is compiled with
`-fstack-protector-strong`, with the canary taken from the hardware RNG at
boot (`src/runtime/stackguard.cpp`). A violation of any of these stops the
system; `tests/memprotect.txt` makes each one happen on purpose
(`src/testcrash.cpp`, test builds only) and checks that it does.

**Secrets in memory:** every heap zeroes every block when it is freed:
the JS heap (`apphost.cpp`, which also makes `realloc` move so the old
block can be zeroed), LVGL's heap (`lv_mem_wipe.c`; labels and text areas
keep copies of what they show), and Circle's heap under them, which also
holds the QR decoder's results, log messages and everything else the
kernel allocates (`patches/circle/0011`). Buffers that held a secret, or a
picture of a QR code, are also wiped explicitly before they go, with
`gk_wipe()` (`src/crypto/wipe.h`), which the compiler cannot drop as a
dead store (`tests/native/check_wipes.sh`): keys and digests in
`src/crypto/`, the decoder's payloads and the scanner's last code, preview
and camera frames when scanning stops. The log keeps nothing in builds
without a serial port: Circle's logger would keep the last 16 KB of lines
and 50 messages in RAM, so nothing is written to it there, and its message
queue is emptied as it fills (`src/kernel.cpp`). LVGL's memory is capped
(64 MB; an app's screen at 32 MB, past which gk:ui throws a `RangeError`).
When an app exits, all its memory is freed, so seed words do not linger
after the app is closed, and the screen is redrawn completely. Data still
in use is of course in RAM; a Pi Zero has no memory encryption.

**Trusted code** is the image (Circle, LVGL, QuickJS, FatFs, `src/`, the
built-in apps) and the apps on the card. Builds are reproducible: with the
pinned compiler (`tools/toolchain.sh`), the same commit gives the same
`kernel.img`, byte for byte, wherever it is built
(`tools/check_reproducible.sh`); so do the release's SD card images and
zips (`tools/make_release.sh`, `tools/check_reproducible.sh --release`;
README.md, "Releases").

**The kernel's hash.** The launcher's system info (key `i`) shows the
SHA-256 the running kernel computed of its own image: its code and
constants as they are in memory, and its data as the firmware loaded it
(Circle hands a copy over before anything changes it,
`patches/circle/0012`). It equals `sha256sum kernel.img`, for every build
(`tests/check_kernel_hash.sh`). It identifies an honest kernel, and catches
a wrong build or a bad copy on the card. It cannot catch a malicious
kernel: that one can show any hash it likes. So against a card someone may
have changed, the defence is to check the card itself on a trusted
computer, with tools that compute the same hashes (`sha256sum` for
`kernel.img` and the boot files, `tools/bundle_apps.py --hash` for the
apps, `--data-hash` for data folders); or to use a sealed build you built
or checked yourself. The app and data hashes the launcher shows are
computed by the kernel, so they are as trustworthy as the kernel: with a
genuine kernel they say exactly what code an app runs.
