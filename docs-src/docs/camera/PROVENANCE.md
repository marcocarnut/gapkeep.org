# Provenance of docs/camera/SPEC.md (clean-room record)

**Process.** SPEC.md was written by the "spec writer" (the dirty-room side). It
is a statement of facts: addresses, bit positions, numeric values, orderings and
timings, in prose and tables. A separate implementer writes the driver from
SPEC.md alone, without reading the GPL-2.0 sources listed below.

All sources were accessed on **2026-11-04**. Commit hashes are the branch heads
at that time.

## Statement

SPEC.md contains **no code** copied or paraphrased from any source: no C, no
macros, no comments, no function or data-structure layouts. Where a GPL-2.0-only
driver was the only available source, these were extracted from it: register
offsets, bit positions, the numeric values written, the order in which a
receiver or sensor must be programmed, and timing constraints. They were then
restated in my own words and tables, next to independent sources wherever one
existed. Such facts are tagged **[GPL-FACT]** in SPEC.md. No identifiers were
carried over, except register and bit names that also appear in hardware
documentation or are needed to identify the hardware field. No comment text
was reproduced. No program structure (function decomposition, state handling,
buffer-queue logic) was copied. The buffer-switching description in SPEC.md 5.4
states hardware behaviour (when addresses are latched, which status bits mean
frame start and frame end), and leaves the design of the driver to the
implementer.

## Corroborating vendor material

| # | Source | Facts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| V1 | MediaTek IMX219 sensor driver file imx219mipiraw_Sensor.c (no licence header in the file), in the same repository as P1, commit bb4a45ea | Contains the same 0x30EB/0x300A/0x300B access sequence and the same twelve 0x4xxx values as G3. Used only to support the statement that these are Sony reference values, not Raspberry Pi inventions. |

## Same-licence material (GapKeep's vendored Circle, GPLv3)

Circle, as vendored in this repository's `circle/` submodule (commit
7a81e1b480fe7d19fc1fc695b89bff0a0848f44b), may be used directly by GapKeep. It
was consulted for: `ARM_CM_CAM1CTL/DIV`, `ARM_CM_PASSWD`; `ARM_IRQ_CAM1` and
`ARM_FIQ_CAM1 = 39`; `PROPTAG_SET_DOMAIN_STATE`, `DOMAIN_ID_UNICAM1 = 14`,
`CLOCK_ID_CORE = 4`; `CGPIOClock` with `GPIOClockCAM1 = 9` and PLLD = 500 MHz
on Pi 1-3; `CI2CMaster` device 0 config 1 = GPIO 28/29 ALT0; `BUS_ADDRESS()`
with the 0x40000000 alias when the GPU L2 cache is enabled; 32-byte cache lines
and `CleanAndInvalidateDataCacheRange` on the Pi 1. Also the repository's own
sdcard/config.txt (no start_x) and docs/CAMERA.md / src/runtime/camera.h for
context.

## Not used

The Raspberry Pi firmware's closed camera stack and the vc4/VideoCore firmware
sources (not public) were not used. No hardware was accessed.
